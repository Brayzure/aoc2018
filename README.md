# Advent of Code 2018
Hey, this is my repository for my Advent of Code 2018 submissions. I'm using this as a chance to brush up on the language I'm most familiar with (Javascript), as well as brush up on some I'd like to know better.

PRs are not welcome, but if you happen to come across a valid test case that isn't covered by one of my solutions, open an issue and let me know!

*But you are missing a lot of solutions for C++!*  
Yeah, I'll get around to rounding everything out towards the end.

*Can I use these to find my solutions?*  
You can, but please don't. The whole point is coming up with a solution yourself! Besides, these solutions are likely not as efficient as they could be.

*I did it anyway, and Advent of Code is telling me the answer is wrong!*  
It should. The data appears to be unique to each participant (or at least,there's many possible data sets). The site also probably told you your "solution" was the same as someone else's, didn't it?

# Running the Code
cd to directory, then
### Javascript
`node index.js`
### C++
`run.bat`
